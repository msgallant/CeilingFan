# CeilingFan

This program is for a simple ceiling fan. You can increase the speed by pulling on the speed pull cord. It has 4 different speed levels: off, 1, 2 and 3. 
When it reaches speed 3 then it ges back to the off position when it is pulled again. You can change the direction which the fan blades spin by pulling on
the reverse pull cord. It alternates between on and off.

There are tests for the ceiling fan class in src/test/java. You can run them after adding JUnit 5 to your build path (which can be done by just adding a new 
JUnit by right clicking on the project, new, other, java, junit and click ok to building the path).
